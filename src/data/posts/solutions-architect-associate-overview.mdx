Hey fellow AWS Cloud Builders! This is an overview of the main services covered by the AWS Solutions
Architect Associate exam. If you would like an introduction to this exam check out my
[Solutions Architect Associate Overview](https://tomspencerlondon.com/posts/solutions-architect-associate-intro)
### 1. Identity Access Management (IAM)
IAM Entities:

In the above diagram we can see the main elements of IAM:
* Identities - used for access to an AWS account
* Users - Users are the owners of identities
* Groups - A user group is a collection of IAM users managed as a unit
* Roles - An identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can do in AWS
* Credentials - Information owned by the user which is used for identification
* Permissions - What a user is allowed to do on AWS
* Policies - A document that determines what actions a user, role or member of a user group can do
* Statements - A collection of elements allowing users to access AWS resources

### 2. Simple Storage Service (S3)

S3 is simple storage service. We can use the SDK an API available with a wide range of languages, the AWS CLI programmable
from the command line and the AWS console to upload and download images to S3.

#### 3. Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Here we see how we can upload a JAR file to S3 and then use our EC2 instance to fetch the JAR
and deploy it
#### 4. Lambda + 5. API Gateway

Here we see how we can use API gateway and AWS Lambda to deploy a Spring Boot App to AWS

#### 6. Auto Scaling

Here we see how we use an AMI to provide an image for each EC2 instance.
We then configure our Auto Scaling to have a minimum, maximum and desired capacity.
The load balancer will then create instances as required.

#### 7 Elastic Load Balancing

Here we can see that we can set rules for the listener from the Application Load Balancer.
According to the rule we can then direct the traffic to the appropriate Target Group.
#### 8. Elastic Beanstalk

#### 9. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

#### 10. Route 53

#### 11. CloudFront

#### 12. S3 Glacier

#### 13. Elastic Block Store (EBS)

#### 14. Storage Gateway

#### 15. Relational Database Service (RDS)

#### 16. DynamoDB

#### 17. CloudWatch

#### 18. CloudFormation

#### 19. CloudTrail

#### 20. CloudTrail

#### 21. Config

#### 22. Key Management Service (KMS)

#### 23. Directory Service

#### 24. Simple Notification Service (SNS)

#### 25. Simple Workflow (SWF)

#### 26. Simple Queue Service (SQS)

#### 27. Direct Connect
