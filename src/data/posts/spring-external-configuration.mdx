#### Spring External Configuration
I wanted to share a little experimentation I did with Spring externalized configuration. The idea came when looking at Wim
Deblauwe's book [Practical Guide to Building an API Back End with Spring Boot](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/spring-boot-building-api-backend).
In his book I was working on the REST API Security chapter and missed a properties value in the **AuthorizationServerConfiguration**
class. The Spring [docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config)
lists 14 different ways to configure property values and I found this list a bit overwhelming!
