#### Spring External Configuration
I wanted to share a little experimentation I did with Spring externalized configuration. The idea came when looking at Wim
Deblauwe's book [Practical Guide to Building an API Back End with Spring Boot](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/spring-boot-building-api-backend/).
In his book I was working on the REST API Security chapter and missed a properties value in the **AuthorizationServerConfiguration**
class. The Spring [docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config) 
lists 14 different ways to configure property values and I found this list a bit overwhelming!

These options become available when you add **@ConfigurationProperties** to an existing class in your application.
So I decided to look at some of the options for a small application to at least get some of the options under my fingers.
The options I will show you in this article cover the majority of possible use cases. I looked at the following configuration
options:
```
3. Config data (such as application.properties files)
5. OS environment variables
6. Java System properties (System.getProperties())
11. Command line arguments
```
The code for this article is available [here](https://github.com/TomSpencerLondon/spring-config-practice).

First, I built a simple REST controller to print out the Configuration:
```java
@RestController
public class ConfigController {

  private final EmailConfiguration emailConfiguration;

  public ConfigController(EmailConfiguration emailConfiguration) {
    this.emailConfiguration = emailConfiguration;
  }

  @GetMapping("/")
  public String propertiesConfig() {
    return emailConfiguration.toString();
  }
}
```
I added the EmailConfiguration class and autowired this class to the controller:
```java
@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "config-test.email")
public class EmailConfiguration {

  @NotBlank
  private String serverName;

  @Email
  private String email;

  public String getServerName() {
    return serverName;
  }

  public void setServerName(String serverName) {
    this.serverName = serverName;
  }

  public String getEmail() {
    return email;
  }

  public void setEmail(String email) {
    this.email = email;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "EmailConfiguration{" + "serverName='" + serverName + '\'' + ", email='" + email + '\'' + '}';
  }
}
```
I added a toString method on the EmailConfiguration class to show the values on the endpoint. I also added **@Component** and
**@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "config-test.email")**. The **@Component** creates an instance for the controller to autowire.
The **@ConfigurationProperties** tells the configuration processor that the properties of the class should be made available
for externalized configuration. The **prefix** annotation value gives a namespace for the properties so the values for the fields.
We can then run **mvn verify** to package our application to a JAR file.

#### 1. Application Properties
The values can then be set in the application.properties file like so:
```bash
config-test.email.email=tom@email.com
config-test.email.server-name=smtp.email.com
```
We then run our application like so:
```bash
 java -jar target/config-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
And we see in our browser on **localhost:8080**:
> EmailConfiguration{serverName='smtp.email.com', email='tom@email.com'}

This means we have successfully referred to our application.properties file to set values in our application. Yay!

#### 2. Java system properties
We can also set values for the application to read as part of our jar command like so:
```bash
java -Dconfig-test.email.email=wim@wim-email.com -Dconfig-test.email.server-name=smtp.wim-email.com -jar target/config-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
This allows us to set the variables as system properties and the values take precedence over the values set in our application.properties.
We see the following on the browser on **localhost:8080**:
> EmailConfiguration{serverName='smtp.wim-email.com', email='wim@wim-email.com'}

It works. Yay!

#### 3. Command line arguments
We can also set the correct values as command line arguments when we run our jar file like so:
```bash
java -jar target/config-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --config-test.email.email=wim@wim-email.com --config-test.email.server-name=smtp.wim-email.com
```
Again we see the correct values in the browser on **localhost:8080**:
> EmailConfiguration{serverName='smtp.wim-email.com', email='wim@wim-email.com'}

Success!

#### 4. OS Environment variables
Finally, we can set the values as environment variables on the machine that we run our application.
We do this by setting the values as ENV variables on our Operating System. I am using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)
so my configuration is slightly different. For normal bash profile we would use **export**.
```bash
set -x CONFIGTEST_EMAIL_SERVERNAME smtp.wim-email.com
set -x CONFIGTEST_EMAIL_EMAIL wim@wim-email.com
```
We can check we have set the environment variables correctly with **printenv**:
```bash
CONFIGTEST_EMAIL_EMAIL=wim@wim-email.com
CONFIGTEST_EMAIL_SERVERNAME=smtp.wim-email.com
```
Now when we run the jar command:
```bash
java -jar target/config-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
We also see the correct values on **localhost:8080**:
> EmailConfiguration{serverName='smtp.wim-email.com', email='wim@wim-email.com'}

#### Conclusion
So there you have it, a little tour of setting values for running spring jar files with external configuration.
Very useful when we want to set values from outside our application without having to recompile the whole application.
