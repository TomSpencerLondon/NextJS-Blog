# Social Network

## Introduction

### The Power of Serverless on AWS
Serverless computing on AWS offers unparalleled scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, making it an ideal choice for modern application architectures. By leveraging services like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3, developers can build highly responsive and event-driven applications without worrying about infrastructure management. This architecture allows businesses to focus on delivering value quickly while maintaining resilience and performance.

One of the most compelling use cases for serverless is in building social networks. Traditional architectures often struggle with traffic spikes, high operational costs, and monolithic codebases that slow down innovation. Serverless addresses these challenges by providing automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and event-driven workflows that allow for independent feature deployment.

### Inspiration for This Article and System Design
The inspiration for this design comes from real-world experiences and insights shared by experts such as Yan Cui in his work *[How to Build a Social Network Entirely on Serverless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0SHFJDMpgc)*. The case study details how serverless can transform a monolithic social platform into a highly scalable, event-driven system that efficiently handles unpredictable traffic surges, reduces operational costs, and accelerates feature releases.

By adopting a serverless-first approach, we aim to achieve:
- **Improved developer velocity** through independent and rapid deployments.
- **Cost efficiency** by eliminating over-provisioned infrastructure.
- **Scalability** to handle millions of users dynamically.
- **Event-driven architecture** for better system modularity and resilience.

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of how to build a social network leveraging AWS serverless services, inspired by industry best practices and real-world implementations.

## System Requirements

### Functional:
- Users can create accounts, add profiles, and update details.
- Users can follow/unfollow other users.
- Users can post content (text, images, videos).
- Users can like, comment, and share posts.
- Users receive real-time notifications (new followers, likes, mentions, comments, etc.).
- Users can search for other users or content.
- A feed shows relevant content based on friends, follows, and recommendations.

### Non-Functional:
- System should support millions of concurrent users.
- **Low latency**: API response times should be < 200ms.
- **Scalability**: Should handle rapid spikes in traffic.
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime.
- **Security**: User authentication with OAuth (Google, Facebook, Twitter).
- **Data consistency**: Eventual consistency for high availability.

## Capacity Estimation
- **Users**: Assume 100 million users, with 10% active daily.
- **Posts**: 10 million posts per day.
- Average post size = `500KB`.
- Total storage needed = `5 TB/day`.
- **Likes and Comments**: 50 million likes/comments per day (each `100 bytes`).
- Total metadata storage per year = `1.8 TB`.
- **API Requests**: 20 API calls per user per day.
- Peak load = `200K requests per second`.

## Database Design

### Entities / Tables:
- **Users**
- **Friendships**
- **Posts**
- **Likes**

### Relationships between Entities:
- **Users ↔ Friendships** (Many-to-Many) – Users can have multiple friends.
- **Users ↔ Posts** (One-to-Many) – A user can create multiple posts.
- **Users ↔ Likes** (Many-to-Many) – A user can like multiple posts.
- **Posts ↔ Likes** (One-to-Many) – A post can have multiple likes.

### Primary and Foreign Keys:

#### **Primary Keys (PK)**
- `users.user_id`
- `posts.post_id`

#### **Foreign Keys (FK)**
- `friendships.user1_id → users.user_id`
- `friendships.user2_id → users.user_id`
- `posts.user_id → users.user_id`
- `likes.user_id → users.user_id`
- `likes.post_id → posts.post_id`

### SQL Table Definitions:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    name STRING,
    email STRING,
    profile_image STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE friendships (
    user1_id STRING,
    user2_id STRING,
    status STRING,  -- 'pending', 'accepted'
    friendship_strength INT,  -- 1 (Weak), 2 (Medium), 3 (Strong)
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
    post_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id STRING,
    content STRING,
    media_url STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE likes (
    user_id STRING,
    post_id STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Request Flows

### 1. **User Signup & Authentication Flow**
#### **Scenario:** A user signs up and logs in.

**Request Flow:**
1. User submits credentials → `POST /api/auth/signup`
2. API Gateway forwards request to `AuthService`.
3. `AuthService` validates credentials using Cognito.
4. If valid, Cognito generates JWT token and returns it to `AuthService`.
5. `AuthService` sends JWT back to API Gateway.
6. User receives authentication token and can now make further requests.

### 2. **User Posts a New Message**
#### **Scenario:** A user creates a new post.

**Request Flow:**
1. User submits post request → `POST /api/posts`
2. API Gateway forwards request to `PostService`.
3. `PostService` stores metadata in RDS (PostgreSQL).
4. If media is attached, `PostService` uploads it to S3.
5. `PostService` sends an event to `FeedService` to update the user’s timeline.
6. `PostService` triggers SNS notifications to notify followers.

### 3. **User Retrieves Their Feed**
#### **Scenario:** A user fetches their personalized timeline.

**Request Flow:**
1. User requests feed → `GET /api/feed`
2. API Gateway forwards request to `FeedService`.
3. `FeedService` checks `ElastiCache (Redis)` for cached feed.
4. If **cache hit**, return feed instantly.
5. If **cache miss**, query DynamoDB for recent posts from followed users.
6. `FeedService` ranks the feed using `BigQuery (Engagement Data)`.
7. Feed is returned and stored in `ElastiCache` for faster retrieval.

### 4. **Friend Recommendation Flow (Using SALSA Algorithm)**
#### **Scenario:** System recommends friends to a user.

**Request Flow:**
1. User requests friend suggestions → `GET /api/recommendations`
2. API Gateway forwards request to `RecommendationService`.
3. `RecommendationService` queries `BigQuery` to compute SALSA-based recommendations.
4. `BigQuery` analyzes mutual friends, engagement, and bipartite graph structure.
5. `RecommendationService` returns ranked friend suggestions.

# **Detailed Component Design**

## **Feed Service: Caching & Ranking**

### **Overview**
- The **Feed Service** is responsible for generating and delivering a personalized timeline for users.
- It **fetches posts** from followed users, **ranks** them, and **caches** results for fast retrieval.
- **Uses Redis (ElastiCache) for caching** and **BigQuery for ranking**.

### **How the Feed Service Works**
1. **User Requests Feed** → API Gateway forwards request to `FeedService`.
2. **Check Cache (Redis) for Feed**:
- If **cache hit** → Return cached feed instantly.
- If **cache miss** → Query DynamoDB for latest posts from followed users.
3. **Rank Feed Using BigQuery**:
- Fetch engagement data (likes, comments, shares).
- Apply ranking algorithm to order posts.
4. **Cache the Ranked Feed in Redis** for future requests.

### **Scaling Considerations**
- **Read-heavy system** → Caching (Redis) reduces database load.
- **Frequent updates** → TTL (Time-To-Live) of `30 seconds` ensures freshness.

### **Scaling Solution**
- **Shard Redis by user ID** → Distributes load.
- **Use a write-through cache** → Cache updates when a new post is created.

## **Recommendation Service: Friend Suggestions using SALSA**

### **Overview**
- The **Recommendation Service** suggests new friends to users.
- **Uses SALSA (Stochastic Approach for Link-Structure Analysis)** to rank friend suggestions.
- Implements **graph traversal** over user-follow relationships.

### **How the Recommendation Service Works**
1. **User Requests Recommendations** → API Gateway forwards request to `RecommendationService`.
2. **Fetch Mutual Friends Data from BigQuery**.
3. **Run SALSA Algorithm**:
- Perform **two-step random walk** from the user.
- Alternate between **“hubs”** (followers) and **“authorities”** (followed users).
- Compute **ranking scores** based on visit frequency.
4. **Return Friend Suggestions**.

### **Scaling Considerations**
- **BigQuery runs in parallel** → Handles millions of social connections efficiently.
- **Batch processing recommendations every few hours** → Avoids unnecessary recomputation.
- **GraphDB (Amazon Neptune) as an alternative** for real-time recommendations.

## **Real-Time Engagement Tracking with AWS Kinesis**

### **Overview**
- **Tracks user engagement in real-time** (likes, comments, shares).
- Uses **AWS Kinesis** to capture streams of interactions.
- **Processes data with BigQuery** to update rankings dynamically.

### **How the Real-Time Tracking Works**
1. **User interacts with a post (like/comment/share)** → API Gateway forwards event.
2. **Kinesis captures event stream**.
3. **Lambda processes events** and stores them in **Redshift**.
4. **BigQuery aggregates engagement metrics**.
5. **Feed rankings update dynamically**.

### **Scaling Considerations**
- **Kinesis scales automatically** → Handles millions of events per second.
- **Partitioning by post ID** ensures efficient event ingestion.
- **Aggregating data in Redshift & BigQuery** keeps computation fast.

## **Summary of Detailed Components**

| **Component**          | **Key Features**                        | **Scaling Considerations** |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Feed Service**       | Caching (Redis), Post Ranking (BigQuery) | Sharding Redis, Expiring Cache (TTL) |
| **Recommendation Service** | SALSA Algorithm for Friend Suggestions | BigQuery Batch Processing, GraphDB for Real-Time |
| **Real-Time Tracking** | Kinesis for event streaming            | Kinesis Partitioning, Redshift Aggregation |

# **Trade-offs & Tech Choices**

## **SQL (PostgreSQL) vs. NoSQL (DynamoDB)**

| **Option**       | **Why Consider It?** | **Final Choice & Reasoning** |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **PostgreSQL (RDS)** | Relational, ACID-compliant, supports complex queries | Chosen for structured data (users, posts, friendships). Supports JOINS, transactions, and consistency. |
| **DynamoDB (NoSQL)** | High-speed key-value lookups, good for caching-style operations | Used for fast lookups (likes, quick user interactions) where JOINS aren’t required. |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Use both SQL (structured) & NoSQL (unstructured) | Best of both worlds: SQL for structured social graphs, NoSQL for high-speed reads. |

### **Trade-Off**
- **PostgreSQL** is **slower for read-heavy workloads** compared to DynamoDB.
- **DynamoDB** lacks relational querying, making **recommendations** more difficult.
- **Solution** → **Hybrid approach** ensures optimal performance (**RDS for complex queries, DynamoDB for real-time interactions**).

---

## **Redis Caching vs. Querying Database for Feeds**

| **Option**         | **Why Consider It?** | **Final Choice & Reasoning** |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Fetch feed from PostgreSQL/DynamoDB** | Always up-to-date but slower due to multiple DB queries | Too slow for real-time feed rendering. |
| **Redis Cache (ElastiCache)** | Speeds up retrieval by storing precomputed feeds | Best for low-latency feed delivery. Store top 50 posts per user in Redis. |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Store precomputed feeds but periodically refresh from DB | Chosen approach: Redis stores feeds, DB updates the cache every few minutes. |

### **Trade-Off**
- **Redis is fast** but **requires managing cache expiration** (TTL = `30s`).
- **Direct DB queries** are fresh but slow.
- **Solution** → **Combine both**:
- **Cache recent feeds** for instant access.
- **Trigger DB refresh** when a new post is added.

---

## **SALSA Algorithm vs. PageRank for Recommendations**

| **Option**       | **Why Consider It?** | **Final Choice & Reasoning** |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **PageRank (Google’s Algorithm)** | Ranks users based on total incoming links | Too biased toward high-follower users (celebrities dominate suggestions). |
| **SALSA (Stochastic Approach for Link-Structure Analysis)** | Uses bipartite graphs (hubs & authorities) for better recommendations | Best for Twitter-style friend suggestions (finds users similar to those you follow). |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Mix SALSA with content-based ranking | SALSA for social graph, BigQuery ML for behavioral insights. |

### **Trade-Off**
- **SALSA is better for mutual connections** but doesn’t account for engagement (likes, comments).
- **PageRank is better for global rankings** but favors influencers.
- **Solution** → **SALSA + Engagement-Based ML** for Hybrid Recommendations.

---

## **BigQuery vs. AWS Neptune (Graph DB)**

| **Option**       | **Why Consider It?** | **Final Choice & Reasoning** |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **AWS Neptune (Graph Database)** | Purpose-built for social graph analysis | Harder to scale beyond graph queries. |
| **BigQuery (Data Warehouse for Analytics)** | Works well with batch processing, scaling | Best for large-scale friend recommendations. |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Use BigQuery for batch processing & GraphDB for real-time queries | GraphDB for real-time, BigQuery for large-scale batch ranking. |

### **Trade-Off**
- **BigQuery handles billions of rows** but **isn’t real-time**.
- **AWS Neptune is faster** but **harder to query at scale**.
- **Solution** → **BigQuery for batch processing, GraphDB for real-time analysis**.

---

## **Kinesis vs. Kafka for Real-Time Events**

| **Option**       | **Why Consider It?** | **Final Choice & Reasoning** |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Apache Kafka** | Open-source, widely used, event-driven processing | Harder to manage in AWS serverless environments. |
| **AWS Kinesis** | Managed service, integrates with Lambda & Redshift | Best for AWS-based architectures. |

### **Trade-Off**
- **Kafka gives more control** but **requires manual scaling**.
- **Kinesis is auto-scaled** but **tied to AWS**.
- **Solution** → **Use Kinesis for real-time tracking of user engagement**.

Here is your **Failure Scenarios & Bottlenecks** section formatted in **Markdown**:

---

# **Failure Scenarios & Bottlenecks**

A **scalable social network** must be **fault-tolerant, highly available, and resilient** to failures. Below we discuss potential **failure scenarios**, their **impact**, and **solutions**.

---

## **Database Bottlenecks & Failures**

### **Problem: High Read/Write Load on PostgreSQL (RDS)**
- **Issue:** When millions of users interact with the platform, relational database queries slow down.
- **Impact:** Slower user profile retrieval, delayed posts, and failed transactions.
- **Solution:**
- **Use Read Replicas** → Offload reads from the main database.
- **Cache user profiles and posts** in Redis to avoid frequent database queries.
- **Use DynamoDB** for high-speed lookups (likes, recent activity).
- **Partition database tables** (shard by `user_id`) to distribute load.

### **Problem: Single Point of Failure in RDS**
- **Issue:** If the primary PostgreSQL database crashes, the system goes down.
- **Impact:** Users cannot post, view feeds, or interact.
- **Solution:**
- **Enable Multi-AZ (Availability Zones) for RDS** → Automatic failover to a backup instance.
- **Use periodic database backups & point-in-time recovery** to restore data quickly.

---

## **Cache Invalidation Issues**

### **Problem: Stale Feed Data in Redis**
- **Issue:** The feed stored in Redis may become outdated, leading to users seeing old posts.
- **Impact:** Users miss new posts, leading to frustration.
- **Solution:**
- **Set a short TTL (Time-To-Live) for cache** (e.g., `30 seconds`).
- **Use event-driven updates** (e.g., when a new post is created, update Redis immediately).

### **Hybrid Cache Strategy**
- **Write-through caching** → Store data in Redis first, then update the database.
- **Write-back caching** → Update the database in the background asynchronously.

### **Problem: Redis Overload**
- **Issue:** Redis can become overloaded due to excessive cache writes/reads.
- **Impact:** The entire cache layer crashes, increasing database load.
- **Solution:**
- **Implement cache eviction policies** (Least Recently Used – **LRU**).
- **Shard Redis by user ID** to distribute load across multiple Redis clusters.
- **Set memory limits and monitor cache hit rates**.

---

## **Real-Time Event Processing Failures**

### **Problem: Kinesis Fails to Process Engagement Data**
- **Issue:** If AWS Kinesis goes down or lags, engagement tracking (**likes, comments, shares**) stops.
- **Impact:** SALSA recommendations become outdated, and trending post ranking fails.
- **Solution:**
- **Use AWS SQS as a backup queue** → If Kinesis is unavailable, route events to SQS for delayed processing.
- **Enable Kinesis Auto-Scaling** to handle traffic spikes dynamically.

---

## **Recommendation System Issues**

### **Problem: SALSA Algorithm Generates Poor Recommendations**
- **Issue:** If SALSA has insufficient user data, it may suggest irrelevant friends.
- **Impact:** Users get **low-quality friend recommendations**, leading to disengagement.
- **Solution:**
- **Combine SALSA with engagement-based ranking** (likes, shares).
- **Use BigQuery ML** to fine-tune recommendations based on historical user behavior.
- **Periodically re-train models** to ensure freshness.

---

## **API Gateway & Authentication Failures**

### **Problem: API Gateway Rate Limits too Strict**
- **Issue:** If API rate limits are too aggressive, normal users get blocked.
- **Impact:** Users see **errors** when trying to access the platform.
- **Solution:**
- **Implement dynamic rate limiting** (e.g., adjust based on user activity patterns).
- **Allow temporary rate limit increases** for VIP users or verified accounts.

### **Problem: Cognito Authentication Outage**
- **Issue:** If AWS Cognito fails, no user can log in.
- **Impact:** **Complete system lockout**.
- **Solution:**
- **Use a fallback authentication provider** (e.g., Firebase Auth) in case Cognito is down.
- **Cache authentication tokens in Redis** to allow temporary login even if Cognito is down.

---

## **Traffic Spikes & Scaling Bottlenecks**

### **Problem: Unexpected Traffic Spike**
- **Issue:** A **viral post** or **high-profile user joins** and generates **10x normal traffic**.
- **Impact:** **Database overload**, API latency increases, users face downtime.
- **Solution:**
- **Use Auto-Scaling Groups (ASG) in AWS** to increase compute power dynamically.
- **Distribute requests across multiple regions** (CDN for images, global load balancing).
- **Enable Redis + CDN caching** for high-traffic endpoints.

---

## **Security & Data Privacy Risks**

### **Problem: User Data Breach**
- **Issue:** If a vulnerability exposes user data, attackers can steal profiles, messages.
- **Impact:** **Reputation damage**, legal issues.
- **Solution:**
- **Encrypt user data at rest (AWS KMS) and in transit (HTTPS/TLS).**
- **Use IAM roles with least privilege access.**
- **Monitor logs with AWS CloudTrail for suspicious activity.**

---

## **Summary of Failure Scenarios & Solutions**

| **Failure**                  | **Impact**                    | **Solution** |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **DB Overload**              | Slow response times          | Use read replicas, sharding, Redis caching. |
| **Cache Invalidation Issues** | Stale feed data             | Use TTL-based caching, event-driven updates. |
| **Kinesis Failure**           | Engagement tracking stops   | Use SQS fallback, auto-scaling. |
| **Weak Friend Recommendations** | Low engagement             | Combine SALSA + ML-based ranking. |
| **API Gateway Rate Limits**   | Blocks legit users          | Use adaptive rate limiting. |
| **Authentication Failure (Cognito)** | No logins possible    | Use backup auth provider, cache JWT tokens. |
| **Traffic Spike Overload**    | System crash                | Auto-scaling, CDN, cache optimizations. |
| **Security Breach**           | Data theft                  | Encryption, IAM restrictions, monitoring. |
