I am writing this guide as part of my preparation for the newer AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam.
As a member of the AWS Community Builders program, I have had a very good introduction to the resources available:
1. [Cloud Academy](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/aws-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03-certification-preparation-for-aws-1-7446/)
is full of labs, questions and preparation exercises
2. [Tutorials Dojo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c03/)
has a good series of practice exams
3. Andrew Brown has completed a very helpful overview with his [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Free course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia-UEYYR44s)
4. Stephane Maarek's [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/)

### Recommended Reading:
Here are some links for recommended reading.
You can cover a lot of ground by skimming over what you already know or what you can infer to be true.
In particular, read the first sentence of each paragraph and if you have no uncertainty about what is being said
in that sentence, move on to the first sentence of the next paragraph.
Take notes whenever necessary.

before trying the Solutions Architect Associate so that you have a good grounding in the basics.
